# The frequency, in Hz, at which the filter will output a position estimate. Note that the filter will not begin
# computation until it receives at least one message from one of the inputs. It will then run continuously at the
# frequency specified here, regardless of whether it receives more measurements. Defaults to 30 if unspecified.
frequency: 30

# The period, in seconds, after which we consider a sensor to have timed out. In this event, we carry out a predict
# cycle on the EKF without correcting it. This parameter can be thought of as the minimum frequency with which the
# filter will generate new output. Defaults to 1 / frequency if not specified.
sensor_timeout: 0.1

# ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node both use a 3D omnidirectional motion model. If this parameter is
# set to true, no 3D information will be used in your state estimate. Use this if you are operating in a planar
# environment and want to ignore the effect of small variations in the ground plane that might otherwise be detected
# by, for example, an IMU. Defaults to false if unspecified.
two_d_mode: true

# Use this parameter to provide an offset to the transform generated by ekf_localization_node. This can be used for
# future dating the transform, which is required for interaction with some other packages. Defaults to 0.0 if
# unspecified.
transform_time_offset: 0.3

# Use this parameter to provide specify how long the tf listener should wait for a transform to become available. 
# Defaults to 0.0 if unspecified.
transform_timeout: 0.0

# If you're having trouble, try setting this to true, and then echo the /diagnostics_agg topic to see if the node is
# unhappy with any settings or data.
print_diagnostics: true

# Debug settings. Not for the faint of heart. Outputs a ludicrous amount of information to the file specified by
# debug_out_file. I hope you like matrices! Please note that setting this to true will have strongly deleterious
# effects on the performance of the node. Defaults to false if unspecified.
debug: false

# Defaults to "robot_localization_debug.txt" if unspecified. Please specify the full path.
debug_out_file: /path/to/debug/file.txt

# Whether to broadcast the transformation over the /tf topic. Defaults to true if unspecified.
